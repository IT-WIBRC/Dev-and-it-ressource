# Algorithms with Python (How to solve algorithms problems step by step)

To solve a problem you should think about 2 things:
  + Correct
  + Efficient

Some of the approaches that we follow to solve problem can be the following:
  + Divide and conquer
  + Greedy approach
  + Dynamic programming
  + Backtracking and branch bound
